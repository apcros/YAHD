A really basic PHP help desk

The tickets are saved in tickets.data, if this file stay empty please consider using the "chmod" command on it.

YES, this help desk is not really a exemple of perfect code, but at least it's simple and -half- working.

(The UI is obviously made with the twitter bootstrap)
